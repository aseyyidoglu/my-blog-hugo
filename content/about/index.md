I completed two bachelor of science degrees in naval architecture and industrial engineering, in 2014 and 2016 respectively. Besides I have more than 5 years of work experience in data-driven digital transformation projects. Playing a generalist role among several business functions, I developed a good understanding of how businesses generate and use data across different disciplines. I develop software, analyze data, manage projects and administer a business while actively looking for opportunities to contribute in learning of others and develop additional skills to progress in my career.
