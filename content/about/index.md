I am an engineer specialized in process planning and project management with over 5 years of experience. On the side, I develop solutions for data analysis, automation and internet. Working across telecommunications, medical technologies, community services and hospitality industries helped me to gain a wide perspective on common needs of an organization. 

Thanks to that, I became proficient in analysing business needs, communicating with a wide range of stakeholders, formulating solutions and writing business documents. Today, I work towards gaining more technical skills and business knowledge to develop and deliver larger projects to scale while offering my knowledge and expertise for others.

I can help you with writing business documents, planning business processes, analyzing your data, and managing your projects and teams. My skills in critical thinking, planning and communications will help us together to achieve success. Please reach out to me on ali.seyyidoglu@gmail.com for your questions and to explore opportunities of working together.
