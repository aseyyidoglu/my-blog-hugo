I have always been wanting to write a professional personal blog. And indeed, I wrote blog posts in the past, but never been consistent. 
I thought I'd give it a try again. And here we go. 

I want to list out what technologies I use in this blog. I use GitHub as a code repository. I wrote this blog post on GitHub
app â€“ extremely intuitive experience of modifying documents in source code. I also use speech-to-text to make writing
experience even quicker and more comfortable.

This blog uses Hugo as a static site generator and source code is seeved by Netlify. I used to buy a domain name but I have gone broke long time ago. A paid domain is not an option for me at the moment.
